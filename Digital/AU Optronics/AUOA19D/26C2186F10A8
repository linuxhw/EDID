Warnings:

Block 0, Base EDID:
  Missing Display Product Name.
Block 1, CTA-861 Extension Block:
  IT Video Formats are overscanned by default, but normally this should be underscanned.
  Colorimetry Data Block: Set the sRGB colorimetry bit to avoid interop issues.
EDID:
  Base EDID: Some timings are out of range of the Monitor Ranges:
    Horizontal Freq: 139.250 - 278.502 kHz (Monitor: 279.000 - 279.000 kHz)
    Maximum Clock: 1114.010 MHz (Monitor: 1110.000 MHz)

Failures:

Block 0, Base EDID:
