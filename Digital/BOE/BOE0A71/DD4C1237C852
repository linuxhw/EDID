Warnings:

Block 0, Base EDID:
  Missing Display Product Name.
Block 1, CTA-861 Extension Block:
  IT Video Formats are overscanned by default, but normally this should be underscanned.
  Add a Colorimetry Data Block with the sRGB colorimetry bit set to avoid interop issues.
EDID:
  Base EDID: Some timings are out of range of the Monitor Ranges:
    Horizontal Freq: 88.800 - 244.204 kHz (Monitor: 244.000 - 244.000 kHz)

Failures:

Block 1, CTA-861 Extension Block:
  Required 640x480p60 timings are missing in the established timings and the SVD list (VIC 1).
  Missing VCDB, needed for Set Selectable RGB Quantization to avoid interop issues.
Block 2, DisplayID Extension Block:
  DisplayID Base Block has no product type.
EDID:
  DisplayID: Missing DisplayID Product Identification Data Block.

EDID conformity: FAIL
